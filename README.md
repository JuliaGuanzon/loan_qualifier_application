# loan_qualifier_application

User Story

As a user, I need the ability to save the qualifying loans to a CSV file so that I can share the results as a spreadsheet.

1. Given that I am using the loan qualifier command-line interface (CLI), when I run the qualifier, then the tool should prompt the user to save the result as a CSV file
2. Given that there is no qualifying loans when prompting a user to save a file, then the program should notify the user and exit.
3. Given that I have a list of qualifying loans, when I am prompted to save the results, then i should be able to opt out of saving the file.
4. Given that I have a list of qualifying lonas, when I choose to save the loans, the tool should prompt for a file path to save the file.
5. Given that I am using the loan qualifier CLI, when I choose to save the loans, then the tool should save the result as a CSV file.
