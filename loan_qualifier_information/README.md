# Loan Qualifier Application

The loan qualifier application is a helpful tool for people who are looking to apply for a loan. This application is useful to any user as it is an interactive application that gathers qualifying loans for each user's circumstance. The best feature in this program is the user's ability to save the loans they have qualified for in a spreadsheet. It saves the user time by creating a list of loans with the criteria for the loan (ie. Debt to Income, maximum loan to value,minimum credit score). This enhancement to the application will make it efficient and pain-less for the user to find a loan.
